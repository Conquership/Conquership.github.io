<h1>About</h1>
<section>Conquership is an RTS game. The release date of the game is unknown, it may never be released. This game is just a project of mine, and I want to improve my skills as a programmer and see how far I'll get on my biggest project.  </section>
<h1>Contact</h1>
<section>If you have any questions, you can contact the main dev (and only so far) at contactconquership@gmail.com or you can DM me in discord at "conquership"</section>
